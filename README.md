# Names, back-end

This is the node.js back-end of a simple web application with names. It serves the names and their amounts in JSON-format to the front-end (found in the repo [names](https://github.com/hannayj/names)). The code is based on [Full Stack Open -course of Helsinki University](https://fullstackopen.com).

In order to run the server in development mode, run *npm run dev* in the terminal. The server will run in port 3001 and the api can be found in: /api/names.

The application is also in [Heroku](https://mighty-earth-09954.herokuapp.com).
